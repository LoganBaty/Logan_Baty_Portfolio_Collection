        "description": "The Lib Tech T.Rice Pro HP C2 Snowboard was born and raised in Jackson Hole. If that doesn't mean anything to you, let us break it down: it's annoyingly good at everything, loves a good cliff or couloir, and it invades Moab in the off season. If it can handle Corbet's, it can definitely handle your neck of the woods, so level up your game with Travis Rice's baby.",

        "description": "The CAPiTA Defenders of Awesome Snowboard is for riders who want to be remembered as heroes of shred. On the right side of history, whether regular footed or goofy. This board is on some intergalactic Excalibur wavelength, a weapon of righteous rad that'll slice through the BS and just plain rip. Park, high speed groomers, pow, leftovers, steeps, whatever: this is the choice for hot-dogging boardriders who prefer a cambered twin. With the future of Awesome at stake, how could you afford to ride anything else?",

        "description": "If you're going to add one Burton board to the quiver, it's gotta be the Burton Custom Snowboard. In fact, you may as well donate the rest of that quiver to your firewood pile, because the Custom will slot in for just about any day of the season. The combination of traditional camber with a directional twin shape and a setback stance is straight out of the snowboarding hall of fame, a tried and true recipe for all mountain prowess. Add a lightweight wood core backed up by chatter damping carbon highlights, and the Custom is calm, collected, and capable in all conditions – a slam dunk for your daily driver.",

        "description": "The CAPiTA Outerspace Living Snowboard is the perfect match for those who head out with a 'freeride, but make it fun' style. It's an all terrain directional twin that with a hybrid camber profile and a slight setback, making it an excellent choice for shredding in powder, crud, and challenging terrain. Also, the newly added Certified Multizone Core enhances the board's durability and strength in high-impact zones, taking a bit of sting out of coming up short. This board is an excellent choice for anyone looking to explore the outer limits and venture into deep space like a freestyle blastronaut.",

With the change to a 105mm waist last season, the Atris becomes even better on hard snow and more directionally stable when you really need or want to pin it - say straight lining it over pesky 'shrunds and the like. The Atris has been at the top of many elite freeride wish lists for a while now, and the remarkable combination of stability and high stakes handling are the reason. If your preferences run away from the tame and groomed, you probably can't make a better choice than the Atris.",
