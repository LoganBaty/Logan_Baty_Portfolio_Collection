
It's late October. You're on a road somewhere deep in the green forests of the Pacific Northwest, not sure if you're in Oregon still or 
if you've crossed into Washington. You had decided a solo road trip to the coast was a good way to relax during your University's Fall 
Break. 

The sun is below the horizon, and you realize you haven't seen a town for miles. Suddenly, the gas tank light turns on. Panic starts to 
rise as you realize you're about out of gas. The nearest town behind you is well out of range, so you continue forward until the car 
sputters and dies. You pull to the side of the road next to some sort of a trailhead, remembering how you also haven't seen another 
car it what seems like hours. 

With sunlight practically gone and no cell service, you have a decision to make. Do you walk along the road, hoping to find someone
else driving on this rural road? Or do you enter the trail with hopes of finding someone's cabin in the woods?

Type "road" to continue walking along the road, or type "trailhead" to enter the trail.
