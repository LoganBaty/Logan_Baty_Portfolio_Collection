
You start your way back down the trail. Your heart is racing as you scan around you. You fear the creature
could appear at any moment. Eventually, you find the road once more. As you approach your car, you look 
up and see the hopeful sight of headlights approaching you in the distance. You wave them down and tell
them your need of help as your hands shake. You are saved.
