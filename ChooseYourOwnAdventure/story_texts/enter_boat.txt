
You choose to get in the canoe. You quickly grab the paddle next to it and push it into the water as 
fast as you can. You take a few steps into the water and then jump in. You've never paddled faster
in your life. After a few moments of paddling you take a look behind you. From the trees you see 
the yellow glowing eyes looking back at you. It stopped chasing you! Relieved, you keep rowing to get
further on the lake. 

You look to the other side, which is maybe a 10 minute paddle away. You could make it over there, but 
you also wonder if staying on the lake might be the safest option, although you may have to wait out 
the night. 

Do you stay on the lake to wait? Or do you paddle to the other side? 

Type "stay on lake" to stay till morning, or type "paddle" to paddle to the other side.
