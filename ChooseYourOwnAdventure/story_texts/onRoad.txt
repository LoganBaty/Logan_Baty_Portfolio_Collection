
You decide to keep going on the road and pass the trail. There has to be another car soon, right? Time keeps passing as the night seems to get
even darker. As you're starting to wonder if you'll ever find someone to help, you notice something further up the road. A tall figure looms
in the distance. You're shocked at its shear size. It has to be nearly 9 feet tall, you think to yourself. Suddenly, the figure turns to face
you. You see the yellow glow of its eyes as you feel chills run down your spine. What is that?? You know you have to run, but to where? You can 
either book it straight into the woods, hoping to lose sight of that massive creature, or you can try to run back to your car in hopes of having
some sort of shelter. What do you do?

Type "run into woods" to flee the road, or type "head back" to run back to the car.
