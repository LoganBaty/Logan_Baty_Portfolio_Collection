
With the rifle, you confidently decide to leave the shed and go after the creature. You search around the 
cabin but you find nothing. You start to wonder if you can make your way back to the road from here. 
You can either follow the trail back the way you came, or try to make a shortcut by cutting through the 
woods. 

Type "use trail" to follow the trail, or type "cut trail" to trailblaze.
