
You choose to wait it out on the lake. You paddle to the center of the lake, fearful of being anywhere
near the shore. You shiver from the wind, your legs soaked. Bugs swarm around you. You fall in and 
out of sleep as you float around. After an eternity, you start to see light along the horizon.

The sun creeps up, driving away the dark, scary night, to reveal the beauty of the lake and surrounding
forest. You paddle back to the shore, confident in the light. As you retrace your steps back through the 
trail, you find the road again. A passing cars stops as you wave it down. You've made it through the 
scariest night of your life.
