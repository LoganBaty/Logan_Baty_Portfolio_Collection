
You turn left, booking it down the path. The sound of tree branches snapping behind you lets you know
you're being chased. 

As you run, you find the trail ends at the shore of a lake. There is a small canoe at the shore. 
You could try to escape over the water, or you could keep running along the shore in search of 
another possible escape.

Type "get in" to take the canoe on the water, or type "follow shore" to keep along the banks.
