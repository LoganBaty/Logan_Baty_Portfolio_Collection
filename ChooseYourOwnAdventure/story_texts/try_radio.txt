
You rush to the radio. You press the button and speak into it. Your fearful voice echoes in the abondoned station. As you talk, you hear the 
sound of nearby branches breaking. The creature is close. All the sudden you are startled by the sound of a voice coming from the radio. The
radio crackles, making it difficult to hear what the person is saying on the other end of the line. You realize the voice is loud enough to 
give away your location. Should you quickly turn the radio off, hoping to hide from the creature? Or do you talk back and hope you can get 
information on how to leave?

Type "turn off" to turn it off, or type "talk back" to conversate.
