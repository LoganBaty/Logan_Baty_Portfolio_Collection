
You can't wait all night, you need to get out of here. You continue paddling quickly, adrenaline pumping 
through you. You pull up to the shore, grateful to be on the other side of the lake. You look back,
unable to see anything on the other side. Relieved, you look back at the woods in front of you. 
Suddenly, the feeling of relief dissapears with fear taking over. In the dark, you see not just one set 
of eyes but three. 

You nightmare got worse. Out steps three massive, furry creatures. You let out one final scream as 
you realize your doom.
