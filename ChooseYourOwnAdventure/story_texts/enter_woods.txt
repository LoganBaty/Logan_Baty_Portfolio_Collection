
You choose to head straight into the woods. You feels the brush and trees smack across your arms and legs as you sprint, trying not to fall. You
hear the crunch of twigs and branches behind you. It's chasing you! You look up ahead, trying to think of what to do. In the pale moonlight, you 
see the forest rise up the side of a mountain. You could possibly find a lookout spot up there to know where to run, you think as sweat is 
beading down your face. To the other side, you see what looks to be some sort of structure. It looks to be some kind of forest ranger station!
Do you try to find a lookout on the mountain, or do you make a break for the ranger station?

Type "mountain" to head up the to the top, or type "ranger station" to investigate the station.
