
You decide to try the trailhead, hoping to possibly find someone or something to help you out. As you
walk, you notice the forest has become eerily quiet. You get the growing feeling that you aren't alone
out here. Something is watching you. 

You begin to glance around you. Your imagination runs wild as you wonder what it could be. Suddenly,
a twig snaps behind you. You look, and in the middle of the path is something huge. An ape-like creature,
standing more than 9 feet tall, looks right at you. Your body freezes. The creature starts toward you,
snapping you out of your trance. You turn and book it down the trail.

As you run, you see a small trail that leads to some sort of structure. A cabin maybe? You wonder if 
you should run towards it or if you should continue down the trail. 
to the trailhead and enter the forest. You see a cabin as you run.

Type "approach cabin" to head to the cabin, or type "keep running" to continue running.
