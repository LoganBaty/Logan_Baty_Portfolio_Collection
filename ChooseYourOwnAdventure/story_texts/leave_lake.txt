
You decide to keep running instead of hopping in the canoe. You run down the shore for a while longer. You look back and see the creature also on
the shore, heading in your direction. You head into the woods to try to lose it.

As you run, you look up ahead and see an overlook up ahead on top of the mountain
you could run up to. You also catch something else in the corner of your eye. A building! It looks like it could be an old forest ranger station.

Do you try your chances up the mountain? Or do you head for the ranger station?

Type "mountain" to head up to the overlook, or type "ranger station" to try your chances with the station.
