
You decide to finally ditch the road, heading into the forest. As you run, you look up ahead and see an overlook up ahead on top of the mountain
you could run up to. You also catch something else in the corner of your eye. A building! It looks like it could be an old forest ranger station.

Do you try your chances up the mountain? Or do you head for the ranger station?

Type "mountain" to head up to the overlook, or type "ranger station" to try your chances with the station.
