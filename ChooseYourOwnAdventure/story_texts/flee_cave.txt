
You think to yourself that there is no way you are entering that cave. You turn and head into the thick brush. As you run, a root trips you and 
sends you head over heels, rolling down the hillside. When you finally come to a stop, you look around dazed. After a moment, you recongize the 
fork in the trail that you had once gone down. You decide to head back the way you came.

You find the road once more, as a car approaches in the distance. You wave, stopping them, your night being saved.
