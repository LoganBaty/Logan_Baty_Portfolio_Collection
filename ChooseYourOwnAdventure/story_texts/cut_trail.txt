
You think it will be quicker to cut through the woods. You head in the direction you think the road is.
You try to be quiet as you walk, but twigs snap between your feet. You keep walking and walking, but 
the forest seems to get thicker and thicker. 

After a few minutes, you realize you are completely lost. Dread fills your body. Suddenly you hear a 
loud growl from behind you. You turn and shoot, but it is too late. The creatures rushes you as the last
thing you remember is the smell of its nasty breath.
