
You decide to keep your head down and continue sprinting. Your heart feels like it could burst out of
your chest. You think you hear the sound of footsteps closing in behind you. Is it close??

Suddenly you see light ahead of you. Headlights! You continue running, waving your arms. A car slows 
down to approach you. You stop and look back. Nothing but darkness. You tiredly explain to the driver 
what happened. You are grateful to be alive.
