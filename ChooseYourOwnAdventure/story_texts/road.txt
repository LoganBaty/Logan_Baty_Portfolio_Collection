
You decide to keep walking on the road, hopeful to try to flag down a passing car. As you walk, you realize just how secluded this road truly
is. Not a single car has passed, and all you hear is the crunch of gravel under your feet and the sounds of the woods. Eventually, you 
spot another trail that heads into the woods. You wonder if staying on the road will get you anywhere soon, or if maybe taking the trail will
lead to finding someone to help. 

Type "stay" to stay on the road or type "enter trail" to enter the trail
