
You pass the hunting stand, still running for your life. The trail twists and turns as you find yourself gaining elevation. As you run, you see 
markings on the trees that you pass. Scratches and slashes are everywhere. Tree bark litters the forest floor. The trail turns one more time before
revealing its end. In front of you is the mouth of a cave. Its dark entrance is uninviting, but with no more trail to follow, you either enter or 
try your luck through the thick forest. 

Do you enter the cave? Or do you try your luck through the woods?

Type "cave" to enter cave, or type "woods" to run into the woods.
