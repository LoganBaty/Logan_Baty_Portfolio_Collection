
You choose to explore some room, trying to find something to help you. As you search, you find a shotgun leaned up next to a desk. There is a box
of shells next to it. You pick it up and quickly load it, grateful to have a way to possibly defend yourself. You make your way to the window and
glance outside. As you squint against the glass, you see the massive thing walking a few feet away. You could maybe surprise the monster with your
new weapon. Do you try to open the window to shoot? Or do you hold off, hoping it'll leave you alone?

Type "shoot" to let it rip, or type "don't shoot" to hold off.
