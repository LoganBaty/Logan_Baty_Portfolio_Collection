
BANG! The dark room lights up for a moment as you pull the trigger. The loud shot in contrast to the dark night makes you jump. As your eyes 
readjust to the darkness, you look outside again. There is nothing there! "How is that possible?", you wonder to yourself. You take a step
outside to investigate, clutching the shotgun in your white-knuckled hands. As you get to the spot where the creature was, you find it completely 
empty. As you stare at the spot, you hear a deep grunting breath behind you. You quickly turn, swinging the gun behind you. There stands the giant
bigfoot creature before you. The forest hears the shotgun blast twice more before going back to its eery quietness. You are lost to the darkness.
