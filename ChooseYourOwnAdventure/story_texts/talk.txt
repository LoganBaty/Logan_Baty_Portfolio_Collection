
You respond to the radio asking for help. As you adjust the dials on the radio, you finally make out what the voice is saying. "Get out of there!
You are in danger! I repeat, you are in danger! Leave the area as soon as you can!" Suddenly, you hear a loud bang. The building shakes all 
around you. The door burst open, a massive shadow now in the doorway. The radio continues to cry out to you, and you reach for the radio to talk 
back. The person on the other line hears your cry for help one last time. The last thing they hear is your scream as the radio connection cuts out.
