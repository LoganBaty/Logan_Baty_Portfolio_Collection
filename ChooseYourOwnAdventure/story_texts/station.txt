
You figure the ranger station is your best bet. You hurry towards the front of the station, quickly trying the door. It's unlocked! You frantically
enter, searching for anything of good use. You spot an old, dusty radio on the desk. It looks like it hasn't been used in years. Do you try to 
see if it works, hoping for a response? Or do you continue exploring to find something that could maybe be more useful?

Type "try radio" to see if it works, or type "keep exploring" to look around more.
