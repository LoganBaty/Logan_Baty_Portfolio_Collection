on the other side of the glass. You continue listening for a minute or two. Is the thing gone? You take a step outside of the station. The sound
of the wind is all you hear. You take a few steps into the darkness, when you hear a bone-chilling cry to your right. You look, paralyzed in fear,
as the massive sasquatch looms before you. It was there, waiting for you to leave. You weren't safe, and you realize now your roadtrip has come to 
a dark end.
