
You look closer at the 4x4. A key is still in the ignition. You try to turn it. The engine sputters for a second and then roars to life. 
You quickly hop on and rev it. It jumps forward out of the shed. You rip it down the trail, too scared to look back. 

You eventually make your way back to the road. You turn and head down the road, not letting off the accelerator. Eventually, you see lights up ahead.
A gas station! You pull in, realizing you've survived a nightmare.
