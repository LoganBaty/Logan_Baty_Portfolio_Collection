
You turn off the road and enter this new trail you just found. You walk for a while in the dark woods.
You start to hear sounds around you. This may have been a bad idea. 

ROOOOAAAAR! Something makes a loud growling noise behind you. You turn around as the hairs on your arms
stand straight up. In the darkness you see a massive, hairy creature with eyes glowing. It stares back 
at you. You decide to turn and run down the path, your head spinning. 

As you run, you find a fork in the trail, with one path going right and one to the left. Do you 
go right or left?

Type "right" to try the right path, or type "left" to head down the left path.
