
You step away from the window, deciding not to shoot. You're just going to wait it out. You kneel quietly with the muzzle of the gun aimed at 
the door. You wait for what feels like an eternity. After minutes of silence, you take a look out the window once more. You can't see anything,
so you take a step outside, quietly searching the surroundings of the station. As you are taking a look around, you discover a 4x4 on the side 
of the building, with a trail leading out into the woods. 

You go up to the vehicle, finding the key still in the ignition. You turn the key. It starts!! You quickly hop on, zipping away from the ranger 
station and down the trail. You drive as quick as you can, imagining the creature to be right behind you. 

Eventually, the trail opens into the road. You take a look, turning onto the asphalt. Headlights! Your fear turns into
excitement as you flag down the car. You made it out of these dark woods alive, with a story almost too incredible to believe.
