
You run to the hunting stand and climb as fast as possible. At the top, you wait, trying to be as silent as possible. Underneath, the creature runs
past the stand and continues down the trail. You wait for a minute, wondering what to do next.

Do you climb down and try to run back the way you came? Or do you wait longer to make sure it doesn't come back?

Type "climb down" to leave the stand, or type "wait" to wait longer.
