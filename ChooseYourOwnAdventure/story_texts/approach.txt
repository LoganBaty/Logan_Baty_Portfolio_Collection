
You head down the small trail to the cabin. The lights are off. It looks vacant. You run to the door and
try the handle. It's locked. You wonder if there is a key around here. Do you look for a key? Or do you
go look around the back of the cabin in search of another way in?

Type "search key" to look for a key, or type "search out back" to look around the outside of the cabin.
