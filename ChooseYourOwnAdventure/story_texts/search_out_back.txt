
You decide to look around back. When you get behind the cabin, you see a shed with its door open.
You enter the shed and see a rifle on the wall with ammo beneath, as well as a dusty 4x4. 
Do you go for the gun or try to start the 4x4?

Type "take gun" to grab the gun, or type "4x4" to try to start the 4x4.
