
You decide to retrace your steps back to the car, running frantically. Where is the car?? You feel like you've been running for forever, but you 
still haven't seen you car on the side of the road. It should be there, right? You feel like the creature is close. Do you make a mad dash for 
the woods? Or do you stick to your hopes of finding the car again? 

Type "leave road" to try the woods, or type "keep going" to stay on the road.
