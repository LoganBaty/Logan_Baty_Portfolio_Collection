
You decide the mountain might offer a good view, hopeful some sort of civilization is close. As you start to crest the peak, you find the only
thing you can see is more trees. You get closer to the edge, thinking to make your way down away from whatever is chasing you. As you approach, 
you find only a cliff in front of you. Your heart starts to pound as you realize your mistake. Behind you, you hear the chasing footsteps stop.
You turn slowly, finding the creature to be only a few feet away. Your body freezes as it stares back at you. The last thing you remember is the
sound of its roar as it rushes toward you before everything going black.
